Getting Started With PythonPaint

1. Clone the python-paint repo 
2. Create a virtual environment:

cd into the home python-paint directory and execute the following commands:
   $ virtualenv --clear ppaint 
   $ source ppaint/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements
   

3. You should now be able to execute the tensor-flow-intro script:
   $ python tensor-flow-intro 

the output might include some warnings from tensorflow, but should also include a line like:

    W: [ 0.49999878] b: [-0.99999636] loss: 8.81872e-12

if you see that line, you've run the intro script. (though it's up to you to make sure you
understand it!)

4. Explore the other scripts.
