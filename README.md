# python-paint
machine learning, computer vision and graphics for automating drawing and coloring

some planned functionality:
1. Red Ball - machine learning - use Pix to Pix, tensor flow to color balls red
2. DONE Sunflower Paint - use component analysis to color sketched flowers
3. Dragon Paint - machine learning - combine Pix to Pix, tensor flow and component analysis to color dragon sketches
4. Mathematical Daisy - create and paint families/varieties of cartoon flowers using parameters, parameterized curves and intersections of regions
5. Pattern Maker - machine learning - do something like Paint Chainer to take hint of user's paint scribbles and extrapolate to a layered "wallpaper" pattern to color a circle (center of flower) with
