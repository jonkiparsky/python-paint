# python-paint
machine learning, computer vision and graphics for automating drawing and coloring

(in progress)

### DragonPaint 
##### current: 
machine learning training set generator for style to style translation for automated coloring for animation - uses component analysis and geometric relationships to automate training set generation for the colored version in sketch/colored pairs 
##### upcoming: 
combine Pix2Pix, tensorflow and component analysis to color dragon sketches

### other planned and existing python-paint functionality:
2. Red Ball - machine learning - use Pix2Pix (see Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks, Isola, et. al., https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix), tensorflow to color balls red
3. DONE Sunflower Paint - use component analysis to color sketched flowers
4. Mathematical Daisy - create and paint families/varieties of cartoon flowers using parameters, parameterized curves and intersections of regions
5. Pattern Maker - machine learning - do something like PaintsChainer https://github.com/pfnet/PaintsChainer to take hint of user's paint scribbles and extrapolate to a layered "wallpaper" pattern to color a circle (center of flower) with
6. Experiment with CV and machine learning including contour tracing, texture analysis, image moments, edge detection, pattern recognition, classification

    a. Is It Zebra - LBP texture mapping
    
    b. Color quantiztion - k-means clustering
